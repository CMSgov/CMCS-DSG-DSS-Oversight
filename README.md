# Streamlining and improving CMS's oversight of state-run Medicaid IT systems
A repository for DSS' work supporting the Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services (CMCS) to streamline and improve the way we oversee the state Medicaid IT systems.

For more information about who we are and what we are doing, [head to the wiki](https://github.com/CMSgov/CMCS-DSG-DSS-Oversight/wiki).

To track this project, we manage this work through [our ZenHub board](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/cmcs-dsg-dss-oversight-5f1915977f0e450022da42dc/board?epics:settings=noEpics&filterLogic=any&repos=269427572&showEstimates=false&showMilestones=false&showEpics=false&showReleases=false&showDependencies=false).
