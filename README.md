# Streamlining and improving CMS's oversight of state-run Medicaid IT systems
A repository for DSS' work supporting the Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services (CMCS) to streamline and improve the way we oversee the state Medicaid IT systems.

We're still working on setting up this repo (with full wiki and project board functionality), but for more info, [head to the wiki](https://github.com/CMSgov/CMCS-DSG-DSS-Oversight/wiki)!
